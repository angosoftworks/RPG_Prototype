Hyper-Realistic with a painterly touch (oil painting textures, slight grain).

## 4) Gameplay Pillars  

- **NPC Autonomy & Memory:**  
  The village remembers — characters retain knowledge of player actions and world events.  

- **Consequence-Driven Emergence:**  
  No quest markers; every action, inaction, or relationship shifts dynamics in systemic ways.  

- **Social Systems as Gameplay:**  
  Rumors, relationships, power plays, and community politics drive the narrative.

## 5) Player Experience Goal  

The player should feel like a participant in a living, breathing ecosystem — not its protagonist, but an actor whose choices ripple through time, affecting lives in subtle or catastrophic ways. Every silence, kindness, or cruelty leaves a mark.

---

## 6) Target Audience  

- **Age:** 18+  
- **Skill level:** Intermediate to Advanced (systemic depth over hand-holding)  
- **Platforms:** PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S  

---

## 7) Non-Negotiables  

- No quest markers, checklists, or minimaps.  
- No disposable or generic NPCs — every character is unique and persistent.  
- No fast travel.  
- No binary morality system (good/evil choices).  
- No explicit tutorials; the player learns by observing and experimenting.  
- No "save scumming" — events unfold in real time, with limited save options.
